# Pokemon Memory Reader

A BizHawk Lua script that reads live game data from Pokemon ROMs, providing real-time access to party information, stats, and more without needing to save and exit the game.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is ONLY the code for the reader, and does not include a frontend site to view the data. If you would like to view the frontend application, please take a look at the **Frontend** portion of this readme.

## Features

- **Live Data Reading**: Access Pokemon party data in real-time while playing
- **Multi-Generation Support**: Works with Gen 1-3 Pokemon games
- **HTTP API**: Built-in REST API server for external tool integration
- **Comprehensive Data**: Full stats including IVs, EVs, moves, abilities, and more

#### Future Features
- **Battle Tracker**: The ability to track battle information live like the opposing pokemon, their moves, pp, etc. 

## Supported Games

## Installation

1. Download and install [BizHawk](https://github.com/TASVideos/BizHawk/releases)
2. Grab the latest [release](https://github.com/NathanTBeene/pokemon-memory-reader/releases).
3. Load a supported Pokemon ROM in BizHawk
4. Open the Lua Console in BizHawk (Tools â†’ Lua Console)
5. Load `main.lua` in the Lua Console

## Usage

### Basic Commands

After loading the script, you can use these commands in the Lua Console:

```lua
-- Show current party information
showParty()

-- Show available commands
help()
```

### HTTP API Server

The script includes a built-in HTTP server that provides JSON data:

> [!NOTE]
> The server will start automatically when you launch the lua script and will restart when you change games, so for the most part these commands won't need to be used.

```lua
-- Start the API server (runs on localhost:8080 by default)
startServer()

-- Stop the API server
stopServer()

-- Toggle server on/off
toggleServer()
```

#### API Endpoints

When the server is running, you can access:

- `GET http://localhost:8080/party` - Get party data in JSON format
- `GET http://localhost:8080/status` - Get server and game status
- `GET http://localhost:8080/` - Get API documentation

### Front End
For those who are looking for a front end application to use this server, I have a [gitpages](https://nathantbeene.github.io/pokemon-memory-viewer/) open that has my current implementation of the frontend.

##### Features
- Initial Party tracker.
- Changes info based on generation.
- Export to **showdown** button.
- Gets generation-specific sprites.
- Auto-refresh option.

##### Unimplemented
- Battle information.

## Architecture

The project is organized into several modules:

- **`main.lua`**: Main script entry point and command interface
- **`core/`**: Core functionality (game detection, memory reading)
- **`readers/`**: Generation-specific party readers
- **`data/`**: Game data constants and character mappings
- **`utils/`**: Utility functions (config loading, game utilities)
- **`network/`**: HTTP server implementation
- **`debug/`**: Debugging tools and utilities

## Requirements

- BizHawk emulator (latest stable version recommended)
- Supported Pokemon ROM file
- LuaSocket (included in modules directory)

## API Integration

The HTTP API returns JSON data that can be integrated with external tools.
