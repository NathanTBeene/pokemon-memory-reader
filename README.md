- Pokemon Red
- Pokemon Blue  
- Pokemon Green
- Pokemon Yellow

### Generation 2
- Pokemon Gold

- Pokemon Sapphire (v1.0, v1.1, v1.2)
- Pokemon Emerald
- Pokemon FireRed
- Pokemon LeafGreen

## Installation

1. Download and install [BizHawk](https://github.com/TASVideos/BizHawk/releases)
2. Clone or download this repository
3. Load a supported Pokemon ROM in BizHawk
4. Open the Lua Console in BizHawk (Tools â†’ Lua Console)
5. Load `main.lua` in the Lua Console

## Usage

### Basic Commands

After loading the script, use these commands in the Lua Console:

```lua
-- Show current party information
showParty()

-- Show available commands
help()
```

### HTTP API Server

The script includes a built-in HTTP server that provides JSON data:

```lua
-- Start the API server (runs on localhost:8080 by default)
startServer()

-- Stop the API server
stopServer()

-- Toggle server on/off
toggleServer()
```

#### API Endpoints

When the server is running, you can access:

- `GET http://localhost:8080/party` - Get party data in JSON format
- `GET http://localhost:8080/status` - Get server status
- `GET http://localhost:8080/` - Get API documentation

### Debug Commands

For development and troubleshooting:

```lua
-- Debug party data structure
debugParty()

-- Debug ability data for specific Pokemon slot (1-6)
debugAbility(1)

-- Debug ability name mappings
debugAbilityNames(1, 10)
```

## Data Structure

The script provides comprehensive Pokemon data including:

- **Basic Info**: Nickname, species, level, type(s)
- **Stats**: Current/Max HP, nature
- **Individual Values (IVs)**: All stat IVs
- **Effort Values (EVs)**: All stat EVs  
- **Movesets**: Up to 4 moves
- **Status**: Current status condition
- **Items**: Held item information
- **Abilities**: Pokemon ability data
- **Hidden Power**: Type and power
- **Friendship**: Friendship/happiness value

## Architecture

The project is organized into several modules:

- **`main.lua`**: Main script entry point and command interface
- **`core/`**: Core functionality (game detection, memory reading)
- **`readers/`**: Generation-specific party readers
- **`data/`**: Game data constants and character mappings
- **`utils/`**: Utility functions (config loading, game utilities)
- **`network/`**: HTTP server implementation
- **`debug/`**: Debugging tools and utilities

## Requirements

- BizHawk emulator (latest stable version recommended)
- Supported Pokemon ROM file
- LuaSocket (included in modules directory)

## Contributing

This project is designed for educational and research purposes. When contributing:

1. Follow the existing code structure and naming conventions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No supported Pokemon game detected!"**
- Ensure you've loaded a supported ROM in BizHawk
- Check that the game is fully loaded (past the title screen)
- Try restarting the script after the game is loaded

**Server won't start**
- Check if port 8080 is already in use
- Ensure LuaSocket modules are properly included
- Try restarting BizHawk

**Party data shows as empty**
- Make sure you have Pokemon in your party
- Try using the `debugParty()` command to see raw data
- Verify the game version is supported

### Debug Mode

Use the debug commands to troubleshoot data reading issues:

```lua
-- See raw party data structure
debugParty()

-- Test specific Pokemon slot
debugAbility(1)  -- For slot 1
```

## API Integration

The HTTP API returns JSON data that can be integrated with external tools.
